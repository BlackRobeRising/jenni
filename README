# Warnings/Notes
This is an experimental branch for the Pathfinder campaign located here: https://github.com/BlackRobeRising/colonists-player-notes

As such, assume everything is unstable and handle with care. Thanks.

If interested in building modules for this sort of thing, feel free to offer pull requests or fork and build a proper stable branch.

# Original
Installation &c.

1) Run ./jenni - this creates a default config file
2) Edit ~/.jenni/default.py
3) Run ./jenni - this now runs jenni with your settings

Enjoy!

4) Run 'sudo pip install feedparser' to allow the optional rss.py and nws.py modules to work.

For a list of contributions to the jenni fork see the file CREDITS.
